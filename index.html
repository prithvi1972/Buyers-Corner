					</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="qna">
				<h3 class="question">How can I qualify for exemptions on the Capital Gains Tax?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						<p>There are a few exemptions available for long term Capital Gains, if you:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Buy or construct a new house</strong>: If you build a new house or buy one from the money you receive from selling a property, you are exempted from paying the tax on Capital Gains. However, the new purchase should be done either one year before or within two years of sale and the construction should be completed within three years from the date of transfer. The new property bought or constructed should not be sold within three years from the date of its purchase or date of completion of construction.</li>
							<li><strong>Capital Gain Account Scheme- </strong>Through the Capital Gain Account Scheme (CGAS), you can save the received money in designated banks. CGAS helps you in buying time to look for suitable investments as it serves to inform the Income Tax department that you plan to invest the money received; but at a later date.</li>
							<li><strong>I</strong><strong>nvest in Bonds- </strong>You can also invest in financial assets or bonds to save tax. Such bonds are issued by the Rural Electrification Corporation and the National Highway Authority of India and should be bought within six months of transferring the property. You can invest a maximum of Rs 50 lakhs through these bonds.</li>

				<h3 class="question">What is the difference between long-term Capital Gains and short-term Capital Gains?</h3>
				<div class="answer">

						<p>If the house is held for less than three years prior to its sale, it is termed as a short-term capital asset  and any gain arising from the sale is treated as a short-term Capital Gain. There are no tax exemptions for short-term Capital Gains and one needs to pay it according to the applicable tax slab.</p>
						<p>However, if the property is sold after holding it for more than three years, it is treated as a long-term capital asset and the gain arising from it is  called the long-term Capital Gain. Such gains attract a flat exemption rate of 20%.</p>
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3 class="question">How can I convert a leasehold property to freehold?</h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						<p>The property could be converted from leasehold to freehold if the local laws allow it. For example, properties under DDA can be converted to freehold by executing a Conveyance Deed but the same is not allowed if the property is owned by the Noida Authority.</p>

						<p>The difference between a leasehold property and a freehold property lies in its ownership . In a leasehold property, the ownership remains with the concerned local authority or the government (as the case may be). The lease period varies typically between 30 to 99 years. But, this does not prevent the individual owner from selling or perform other transactions with the property, provided the lease deed is registered.</p>
						<p>In case of a freehold property, the owner of the property is the legal owner and can sell/lease/rent the property as per his/her wish .</p>
